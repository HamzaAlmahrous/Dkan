# Dkan

Dkan is an Ecommerce flutter app, and it is the second Ecommerce app I worked on but there is always somethings new to learn every day 🔥.
I used:
- Bloc as a state management
- Localization 🌍
- Shared Preferences to store small data
- Dio package 
Many thanks to [Abdullah Mansour](https://github.com/abdullahmansss) for the backend API's and the great content in his Udemy flutter course.
